###Work Experience

- SKYIT Services - Researcher
    	Project Management: Agile methodologies combined with Jira and Asana have been used in the management of the development of carbon tracking and reduction systems. 
o	The project then reduced the cost by 15% while increasing software quality by 20% due to effective resource utilization with iterative cycles of testing.
	Advanced Data Techniques: Extensive research into data warehousing and ETL to facilitate seamless collection and integration of carbon emission data coming from various sources, such as IoT sensors, energy usage logs, and transportation data.
o	 Improved product performance by 25% by providing an optimized data pipeline and analytics framework for carbon emissions monitoring.
	Experimental Design and Statistical Analysis: Collaborated with R&D teams in the design of experiments that evaluated the impact of operational changes on carbon emissions. Advanced statistical techniques were used to derive actionable insights from these experiments.
o	 Enhanced experimental deliverable efficiency by 30% by applying factorial design and regression analysis to carbon emission datasets. 
	Data Extraction and Transformation: Utilized SQL, Python (scikit-learn, TensorFlow), and R in data extraction, transformation, and loading processes for carbon emission metrics analysis.
o	Mentored and processed more than 1 million records in energy consumption and emissions successfully.
	Data Visualization: Created 5 interactive dashboards within both Power BI and Tableau focused on the key performance indications related to carbon emissions in all sectors of transportation and manufacturing.
o	Delivered insights on hotspots of emissions and their reduction areas, thus helping decision-making based on data.
	Statistical Methods: Applied advanced statistical methods and theories of probability in interpreting the emission trend and modeling future scenarios through analytical tools such as SAS and SPSS. 
	Designed and implemented various Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Neural Networks predicting emission trends to arrive at best reduction strategies.
o	Achieved 95% accuracy for predictive models, hence being able to give valuable insight into bringing forth considerable carbon footprint reductions.
	Research Documentation: The Carbon Emission project maintains exhaustive documentation of methodologies, findings, and recommendations using LaTeX and Confluence. 
o	Authored 5 in-depth reports that were starting points for future R&D and strategy.
